<p class="text-justify" >I would like to introduce myself;I am Bijesh Dhital, son of Mr. Dharma Bhakta Dhital and Mrs. Netra Kumari Dhital .I was born on 16th march, 1998 in Siddhakali-8, Sankhuwasabha. My family is a nuclear happy family consisting of four members. They are my father, my mother , myself and my small sister.I completed my School level from Holy Garden English Secondary School.It lies in the Bhaktapur district of Central development region of Nepal. With the support of the highly-qualified teachers and care of my family, I passed School Leaving Certificate(SLC) securing 82.63% from there in the year 2015AD. After that, I joined Sunshine Secondary School for my further higher education (10+2). To begin with, my favourite subject in school life was computer. i used to spend my most of the leisure time by playing the computer games and watching different entertaining programmes in it. During my school life i learned the basic course of computer like MSWORD,POWERPOINT,MX-EXCEL and soon.Nowdays also i love computer and information technology not only to get entertainment but this is due to fact that i am very interested in new programmes that are operated by computers and new technology. i am very kin to learn about how to design web, how to add animation in videos,how to safeguard our computer networks through programmes and soon.  When i was in grade 11 when I got Wi-Fi in my home.Soon after that i got chance to learn different new programmes of computer and way of operating it. After this, my interest in information technology reached the climax. Then i planned to choose information technology as my carrer subject in bachelor and masters. After taking the final exam of NEB for my  higher education(10+2). I joined the web class and grabbed the basic knowledge about web designing by the use of HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT,BOOTSTRAP.These all curiosities within me regarding the networks,programmes, computers and their components made me believe that Information Technology is the right path for me to achieve my aim and interest.Nowdays in Nepal too the demand of it graduates is more but unfortunalitly there are few educational institutions in Nepal to produce such skilled manpower. They have limited seats and one needs to appear in competitive entrance exams. some of the institions available in Nepal to provide information technology sector education are:Pokhara University, Purbanchal University ,Softwarica , Sunway college and soon. These institutions provides IT courses like BIM, BIT which does not have any particular specialization of branch and are not globally recognized too. So, it is unlikely for me to specialize my course in system analysis and Networking in these Universities. Moreover, it is very difficult to earn the degree equivalent to world class IT institutions here in Nepal. Furthermore,Information Technology is all about practical skills and knowledge to solve the technology related problems. But, in Nepal theory education is given more than practical in almost all educational institutions.beside these problem there are alot of problems in Nepal like there is frequent strikes and bandas here,It colleges and universities in Nepal donot have sufficient computer labs and other relating tools and technology,there are no any international students in the colleges of Nepal.Nowdays in Nepal too the demand of it graduates is more but unfortunalitly there are few educational institutions in Nepal to produce such skilled manpower.
